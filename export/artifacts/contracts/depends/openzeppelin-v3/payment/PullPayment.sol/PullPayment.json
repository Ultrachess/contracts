    "details": "Simple implementation of a https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls[pull-payment] strategy, where the paying contract doesn't interact directly with the receiver account, which must withdraw its payments itself. Pull-payments are often considered the best practice when it comes to sending Ether, security-wise. It prevents recipients from blocking execution, and eliminates reentrancy concerns. TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways to protect against it, check out our blog post https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul]. To use, derive from the `PullPayment` contract, and use {_asyncTransfer} instead of Solidity's `transfer` function. Payees can query their due payments with {payments}, and retrieve them with {withdrawPayments}.",

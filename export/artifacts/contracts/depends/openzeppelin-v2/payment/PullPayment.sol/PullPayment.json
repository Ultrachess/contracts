It prevents recipients from blocking execution, and eliminates reentrancy concerns. * TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways to protect against it, check out our blog post https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul]. * To use, derive from the `PullPayment` contract, and use {_asyncTransfer} instead of Solidity's `transfer` function. Payees can query their due payments with {payments}, and retrieve them with {withdrawPayments}.",
